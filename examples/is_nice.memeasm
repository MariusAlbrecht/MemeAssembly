What the hell happened here? This program reads a decimal number from stdin and tells the user whether is is nice or not (meaning that it is equal to 69 or 420)
What the hell happened here? It does not feature any error handling whatsoever, however it does not crash when providing illegal symbols (e.g. characters) or nothing as input
I like to have fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun main

    sneak 100 r8

    upgrade
        sneak 100 rax
        let me in. LET ME IIIIIIIIN al

        who would win? al or 10

        What the hell happened here? If we land here, the user pressed enter, i.e. al = 10 (\n), meaning that we escape the loop
        where banana

        al wins
        10 wins
        parry 48 you filthy casual al

        upvote r8
        stonks rax
    fuck go back

    banana
    What the hell happened here? Now, we recreate the number, which will be stored in rdx. rcx contains the factor that the current digit must be multiplied by, starting at 1, then 10, ...
    sneak 100 rdx
    rcx is brilliant, but I like 1

    monke uuaauauaua
        who would win? r8 or 0
        What the hell happened here? If we land here, our loop counter is 0. Escape the loop
        return to monke uauauauauaaa

        r8 wins
        0 wins
        not stonks rax

        rax is getting out of hand, now there are rcx of them
        rdx units are ready, with rax more well on the way

        rcx is getting out of hand, now there are 10 of them
        What the hell happened here? Decrease the loop counter and jump back to the loop condition
        downvote r8
    return to monke uuaauauaua

    What the hell happened here? Our loop counter is now at 0, meaning we are done translating the number
    monke uauauauauaaa
    corporate needs you to find the difference between rdx and 69
    corporate needs you to find the difference between rdx and 420

    what can I say except n
    what can I say except o
    what can I say except t

    they're the same picture
    what can I say except n
    what can I say except i
    what can I say except c
    what can I say except e
    what can I say except !
    what can I say except \n

    I see this as an absolute win
