## Printing to the console
### Definition
```what can I say except [ASCII-character/8-bit register]```
### Description
Prints the given character to stdout. The given parameter can either be a letter itself, an ASCII-value in decimal form or an 8-bit register (e.g. al) containing an ASCII-value. Numbers from 0-9 are interpreted as characters and not as ASCII-values. \
All [common escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C#Table_of_escape_sequences) are also supported and can be used without any issues. Here is an overview:

Escape Sequence  | Usage
------------- | -------------
```\n``` | New line
```\s``` / ```space``` | Space
```\b``` | Backspace
```\t``` | Horizontal Tab
```\v``` | Vertical Tab
```\f``` | Formfeed Page Break
```\"``` | Double quotation mark
```\?``` | Question mark
```\\``` | Backslash

?> Printing Unicode-Characters directly is not possible. However, using [this program](https://play.golang.org/p/TojzlTMIcJe), you can get the sequence of commands needed to print your character.
